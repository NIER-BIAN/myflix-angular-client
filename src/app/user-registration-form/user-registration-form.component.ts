  The OnInit interface
  Interfaces define a contract / specify that class must implement certain methods.
  It's purupose is to ensure code consistency and predictability.
  The OnInit interface has only one method: ngOnInit().
  When a class implements OnInit, it's promising to provide a definition for the ngOnInit() method.
  Ng's component lifecycle system will automatically call the ngOnInit() method at the appropriate time
  in the component's lifecycle, after the component has been created and its input properties bound,
  but before the component's view is rendered.

  Think of it like this:
  
  Interface: A blueprint or contract.
  i.e. "If you're going to be this type of thing, you must have these parts."

  Class: A concrete implementation.
  i.e. "I am this type of thing, and here are the parts defined in the blueprint."
